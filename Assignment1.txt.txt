Web Browser:

A web browser is an application for accessing websites and the Internet.

 When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen.

Browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Browser Engine:

A browser engine is a core software component of every major web browser.
 The primary job of a browser engine is to transform HTML documents 
and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual 
representation on a user's device.

Static Site:

A static website is made up of a fixed number 
of pre-built files stored on a web server. 
These files are written in HTML, CSS, and
 JavaScript, which are called “client-side”
 languages because they execute in the user’s
 web browser. When a user requests a page from
 the server with a URL, the server returns the
 HTML file that is specified by the URL and 
any accompanying CSS or JavaScript files.

 The web server does not alter the files before
 they’re shipped to the user.

Dynamic Sites:

 A dynamic website presents different information to
 different visitors. The content that a visitor sees 
can be determined by several factors, such as their 
location, local time, settings and preferences, and/or 
actions they’re taken on the website (e.g., shopping habits)
, making for a more tailored and interactive experience.
